📌 Project Objective  
To design and develop a Pizza Sales Dashboard in Power BI using sales data (Jan 2024 – Dec 2024), supported by SQL queries, to deliver insights into total revenue, orders, pizzas sold, category/size performance, and best/worst sellers.

The dashboard helps business stakeholders monitor Sales KPIs, Daily & Monthly Order Trends, Category/Size Contribution, and Product-Level Performance, enabling Data-Driven Decisions for marketing, inventory, and operations.

## 📊 Live Dashboard
I created two interactive dashboards in Power BI:

- **Home Section** – Sales KPIs, daily/monthly trends, category/size breakdown  
- **Best/Worst Sellers Section** – Top & bottom pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders  

📌 *Note:* The dashboard size is comparatively larger than usual. For the best experience, reduce the view to 70% in Power BI Service.

## 🚨 Business Problem
Without analysis, pizza chains struggle to:  
- Track revenue, orders & pizzas sold  
- Identify busiest days & months  
- Compare categories & sizes by sales  
- Spot best & worst sellers  
- Improve customer targeting & menu planning  

---

## ❓ Key Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total revenue, pizzas sold & AOV?  
- What are the daily & monthly order trends?  
- How much do categories & sizes contribute?  
- Which are top/bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders?  
- What are the busiest days & months?

1. **Data Import** → Load dataset into MS SQL Server  
2. **SQL Analysis** → Queries for KPIs, trends, category/size, top/bottom pizzas  
3. **Data Export** → Export results from SSMS  
4. **Power BI Dashboard** → Build KPIs, trends, category/size, best/worst sellers visuals  
5. **Design & Interactivity** → Add slicers for Category & Date Range
