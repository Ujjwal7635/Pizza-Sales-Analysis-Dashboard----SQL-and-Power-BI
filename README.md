\## 🚨 Business Problem

Pizza chains need clear visibility into sales performance, category contributions, and product-level insights. Without analysis, it becomes difficult to:



\- Track total revenue, orders, and pizzas sold  

\- Identify busiest days \& months for operations planning  

\- Compare pizza categories and sizes by sales contribution  

\- Analyze best \& worst selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders  

\- Improve customer targeting and menu optimization

\## ❓ Key Questions (KPIs)

\- What is the total revenue, total pizzas sold, and average order value?  

\- What are the daily and monthly order trends?  

\- How much do different pizza categories \& sizes contribute to sales?  

\- Which are the top 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders?  

\- Which are the bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders?  

\- What are the busiest days \& months for pizza sales?
